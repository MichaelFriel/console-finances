# Console Finances

## Description

This webpage does not contain any noteworthy UI or content, but instead functions via console logs which express a financial analysis. Having been provided with an array containing month-by-month financial records, the application uses a variety of javascript functions to interpret the data and surface a number of calculations which combine to act as a financial performance breakdown.

**Calculations include:**
* Total number of months in the array
* The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the seven year period
* The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the seven year period
* The greatest increase (and month in which it occurred) in Profit/Losses over the seven year period
* The greatest decrease (and month in which it occurred) in Profit/Losses over the seven year period
